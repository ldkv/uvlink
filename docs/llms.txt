# uvlink

> CLI helper for keeping Python venvs outside synced project folders (Dropbox, iCloud, Google Drive).

## Summary

`uvlink` solves the problem of syncing thousands of small files in Python virtual environments (`.venv`) to cloud storage. It moves the heavy `.venv` directory to a local cache (outside the synced folder) and replaces it with a lightweight symlink.

## Installation

```bash
uv tool install uvlink
```

## Usage

1.  **Link a project**: Navigate to your project and run `uvlink link`.
2.  **Sync dependencies**: Run `uv sync` to install packages into the linked environment.
3.  **List linked projects**: Run `uvlink ls` to see all cached environments.
4.  **Clean up**: Run `uvlink gc` to remove caches for projects that are no longer linked.

## Key Features

-   **Prevents Sync Issues**: Keeps `.venv` out of cloud storage.
-   **Seamless Integration**: Works with `uv`, VS Code, and standard terminals.
-   **Automatic Caching**: Manages environments in `~/.local/share/uvlink/cache`.
